## Agenda

* Background
* Sources of data
* Resources
* Why Map
* Challenges  (actions being take by ODM)
* Next Step


---

## Background
* 2017: CBP worked with Tdh CEP Project to initiate community mapping exercise to identify community assets and Capacity in Mardi, 6th October, Obour, 10th of Ramadan, Nasr City. 
 
* Mid 2017: the first visual presentation of the mapping outcome was presented 
 
* Parallel initiatives  (PI:   database of  Services, services providers  and organizations
 ODM: population mapping) 

---

## Background (contd)

* Late 2017:  Broaden the scope to include  public facilities extending services to refugees, hospitals and health bureaus, post offices, police stations and youth centers and ATM venting mechanise operated by Bank of Alexandra etc. 

* Early 2018:   Started consolidating all  information   in order to have a map that will be useful to all sectors   with  information on PoC  and their location, youth, UAC

## Background (contd)
* Stages of Map Development
 - Static maps of community organization in 6 October
 - Dynamic  map- integrating static and geo-spatial data  


Note: Overview of the presentation structure. Initiaves taken with the available resources. Need of map, challenges and way forward. PLUS DEMO.

## Why Map

Gain better insight, See visual patterns, Identify areas of gaps, Planning and resource allocation, Spatial Analysis


---

## Challenges
1. Inconsistancy (map/code)<!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
1. Inadequacy (level of details) considering the shifting of boundaries for the  existing administrative demarcations – impacts details captured during registration (Timothy)
<!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
1. Data Quality (bad/missing data) eg. TdH<!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
1. Time consuming (cleaning/wraggling) existing information <!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
1. Differences in data maintained my various agencies <!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->

Note: Changing boundaries of Governorates and Districts. Data at district vs governorate level - too detailed (TdH Hospital) vs too little data (schools in governorates). Across the agency data is maintained in different structure - matching them is time consuming.
